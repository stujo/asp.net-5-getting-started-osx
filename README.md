# ASP.NET 5 Getting Started on OSX

* Download the Release Candidate at [https://get.asp.net/](https://get.asp.net/)
 This will install the .NET Execution Environment (DNX) and .NET Version Manager (DNVM) for developing .NET applications. 
* Under installation type I chose not to 'Add to bash' - I'll do that manually using a terminal tab preference by adding ``. source dnvm`` to the tab setup
